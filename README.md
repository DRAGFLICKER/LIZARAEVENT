I’m excited to share that we have successfully developed the front end of "@LIZARA" an event management booking website, at Luminar Technolab . Using hashtag#HTML, hashtag#CSS, hashtag#TailwindCSS, hashtag#GSAP, and hashtag#Bootstrap, we created a fully responsive and visually engaging platform.

A huge thank you to my fantastic team - Aghin P , Karthika M Nambiar, Athira M ,Aswani P, Martin Antony, Mohammed Aslam- for their exceptional collaboration and dedication throughout this project!
